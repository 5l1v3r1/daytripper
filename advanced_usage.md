## Custom Actions

Instead of hiding windows, you can perform custom actions when TX is triggered.

Slide the Mode Select Switch on RX to `CUSTOM`, middle position. After this, `ALT + PAUSE` will be pressed when TX is triggered. 

This key combo doesn't do anything normally, but you can capture it with special softwares, and then perform your own actions. 

### Windows 

You can use [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com). Here's a [sample configuration file](resources/AutoHotkey.ahk) upon which you can tinker with.

### MacOS

You can write an applescript and then make an App Shortcut:
