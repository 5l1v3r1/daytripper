Daytripper consists of a Transmitter (TX) and a Receiver (RX):

TX features a continuous-scan laser rangefinder, and sends a signal to RX when triggered. You place it wherever you want.

RX plugs into your PC, acts like a standard USB keyboard, and presses `Win + M` upon receiving the signal, hiding all windows.

RX can also lock your computer or execute custom scripts.
