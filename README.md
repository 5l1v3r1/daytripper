Daytripper is a laser tripwire that, upon triggering, can:

* Hide all your windows
* Lock your computer
* Execute a custom script

## Buy Daytripper on Tindie!

## How it works

Daytripper comes in two parts: a Transmitter (TX) and a Receiver (RX).

Mount the TX anywhere you want. Plug RX into your computer.

When TX detects motion, RX will press `Win + M` and instantly hide what you're doing.

Alternatively, RX can also lock your PC or execute a custom script.
