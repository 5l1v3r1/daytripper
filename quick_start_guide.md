This guide shows you how to use the Daytripper.

If yours hasn't been assembled yet, please [see this guide to put it together](/assembly_guide.md)

## Getting Started

By now, you should have the assembled transmitter(TX) and receiver(RX) boards.

Your RX board might have a translucent protective cover on it, **`DO NOT PEEL IT OFF!`**

Please observe the names of various parts what will be referred to later:

Let's try it out and see if it works. Plug the RX into your computer. The blue LED should be breathing for 2 seconds and go dim, and the computer should recognize it as an USB keyboard.

Put the TX flat on the table, make sure there is **no obstructions in front of the sensor window**.

Turn it on using the switch on the left side.
