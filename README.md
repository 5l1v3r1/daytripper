## How it works

Daytripper comes in two parts: a Transmitter (TX) and a Receiver (RX).

Mount the TX anywhere you want. Plug RX into your computer.

When motion is detected, RX will press `Win + M` and instantly hide what you're doing.

Alternatively, it can also lock your PC or execute a custom script.
